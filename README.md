# Open Learning Objectives Report Generator, Part 1
​
## Project Overview
​
The first steps towards building a report generator for analyzing data associated with Open Learning Objectives (OLO).
​
Garner insights as to:
* the number of OLOs in a collection
* the number of categories containing OLOs in a collection and # of OLOs in each of the categories
* generate 'by-grade' reports
* use key word searches to locate important concepts

Report Params
* must print out a formatted (human-readable) report
* save generated reports to a new (distributable) file, such as a textfile

## Why I am building this project
It is with great pleasure that I'm integrating three of my most all-consuming interests in this project: high-quality education, Ruby programming language, and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
* Education -I want to create tools that support exceptional educational materials with clear learning objectives - therefore my data for this project is coming form the Open Learning Objectives Project (more below)
* Ruby - The human-readable quality, the flexible and expressive nature of Ruby, and the plethora of community driven documentation make it a joy to work in, and I hope also make it approachable to other programmers
* JSON - The portability of JSON is extremely exciting to me. To me, JSON is much easier to read than most data formatted in CSV files. It is also very easy to track detailed changes to data stored JSON with Git, or other distributed revision control systems. And I when I JSON, Git, and GitHub together, I can see the 'diff' image for each revision on GitHub — gotta love that!
## Data Source
* Data for the JSON file was obtained on GitHub at OpenEd's public repository of [Open Learning Objectives](https://github.com/openedinc/OpenLearningObjectives)
* The Open Learning Objectives project [curriculum license](https://github.com/openedinc/OpenLearningObjectives/blob/master/license.md)
* More information about [Problems That OLO Addresses](https://github.com/openedinc/OpenLearningObjectives/blob/master/README.md)
